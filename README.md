### **Overview**
This project taught me basic JavaScript skills like string manipulation, array methods, and DOM manipulation by building a simple music player app. You’ll learn to create an interactive user interface with play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle buttons, along with a playlist that users can select from.

### **Features**
1. **Play and Pause**: Users can play and pause the current track.
2. **Next and Previous**: Navigate between tracks in the playlist.
3. **Shuffle**: Randomly shuffle the playlist order.
4. **Playlist**: View and select songs from the list.
5. **Album Art**: Displays the cover art of the currently playing song.
6. **Responsive Design**: The app adjusts to different screen sizes for a smooth experience on mobile devices.

### **Technologies**
- **HTML: For structuring the app’s content.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and handling the logic behind the music player.
